  Description: 'C++ is a powerful programming language used over a wide span of applications,
    from operational systems to real-time interactive applications. It was developed
    in the late ''70s enhancing the C language features by fully supporting Objected-Oriented
    Programming, or, as stated simply: by allowing classes. According to the annual
    report by Stack Overflow, C++ is still the 9th most popular programming language
    for both the general public and professionals.

    To create and develop interactive
    applications, the student must know different programming abstraction levels,
    including a lower-level approach that allows for more control of the resources
    available (such as computer memory), leading to a more efficient and high-performance
    application. C++ allows that approach, and it''s used by the industry to create
    breakthrough and innovative applications, especially in the field of Games and
    Interactive Media.

    Additionally, C++ has matured over the decades, adding
    features and becoming a multiparadigm language, leveling up to stand among the
    newest programming languages. At the same time, this course won''t grasp its
    full potential but will lead the student in a comfortable position to study on
    his/her own and learn its darkest and deepest secrets.'
