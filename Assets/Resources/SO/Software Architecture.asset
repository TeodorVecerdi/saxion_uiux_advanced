  Description: "This module is in term 2.2, at this point the students have learned
    much theoretical knowledge of programming from previous modules and gained much
    programming experience from the group projects. The students should have the
    knowledge and skills to make the code function as required. \r\nHowever, functionality
    is only one aspect of programming, there are many other aspects that are crucial
    to a successful project: flexibility, reusability, readability, error tolerance,
    etc. To get fully prepared for the real projects in the industry, students have
    to consider all these during the software design process, and this is where software
    architecture comes in.\r\nIn this module the students will learn how to use UML
    to visualize the code structure and function sequences, apply design patterns
    to improve their code quality, use unit tests to ensure functions work correctly
    and how to do proper code reviews with peers. "
