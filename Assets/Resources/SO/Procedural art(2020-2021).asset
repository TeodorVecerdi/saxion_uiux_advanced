  Description: 'It is generally advisable for future projects that students obtain
    theoretical knowledge of procedural workflows in order to generate digital content
    in a procedural manner as opposed to investing too much time into tedious and
    manual labour. Understanding and being able to apply this knowledge is important
    for establishing a pipeline which improves the workflow and lowers the time it
    takes to author content for everyone involved in the long run. We teach this
    in the context of small-scale assignment using the game engine Unity, pre-existing-
    and self-made tools that enable all CMGT roles to create re-usable, adaptable
    and non-destructive procedural content with an individual approach and focus.

    In
    order to develop media products, both for the movie- and game industry, you need
    to have knowledge about the current technologies used in the field which will
    enable these new workflows. We use technologies and approaches to let digital
    content be generated for us - the developer and the user as well. It is important
    to understand what happens and how things happen in between: how content is authored
    procedurally, what its benefits are and why we should make use of it as developers
    of interactive content.'
