  Description: "During the previous cluster you gained some experience in different
    areas needed to pass this cluster successfully, such as C++, SFML and 3D Math.
    This cluster recaps and builds upon that knowledge and aims to teach you the
    basics of 3D rendering using OpenGL in a practical way. \nThe course is taught
    using C++ and a small in-house engine called the Micro Game Engine (MGE). \nTopics
    include the different libraries required, programmable shader pipelines, lighting
    models and terrain shaders among others."
  Instructors: "Instructors: Hans Wichman; Yvens Rebou\xE7as Serpa"
