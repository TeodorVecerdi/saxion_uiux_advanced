  Description: 'With the rapid development of technology, and the number of devices
    and services that compete for our time and attention, it makes sense that people
    want to consume services and experiences as quickly and as to the point as possible.
    They also need to be enjoyable to use and easy to pick up, or else people move
    on to the next thing that requires our attention. This is why UI/UX, which focuses
    on how users interact with a system in order to improve its acceptability and
    ease of use, is so important nowadays.

    In the previous module (UI/UX),
    students learned and applied UI/UX design theory to develop wireframe interfaces
    for several systems, or improve existing flawed ones. In this module, students
    will a) acquire practical knowledge on developing fully functional solutions
    from Hi-Fi prototypes, b) acquire a deeper understanding of the design of user
    tests/experiments, and c) learn how to analyze the results obtained from user
    tests using descriptive statistics.'
